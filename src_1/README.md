# Second-Order Inference on Simulation Data



To run the code, execute:

```sudo python simulation.py```

The first-order inference's accuracy is 86% which only counts 50% of the total set.

With line 799 
```iter_num = 200``` (selection threshould coefficient is 200), 

and line 166 
```half_bw = 10*360``` (bandwidth is 1 hour)

You should be able to achieve a total accuracy of 84.62%.
